# Data Processing

Often, when we work with Machine Learning, we come across data in its raw format, that is, data simply collected from its natural environment. They need to undergo a process of analysis and transformation so that we can use in methods of classification and prediction later.
Thus, this code was developed that reads an existing .csv file (most of the raw data collected is in .csv), processed according to the need of the chosen Machine Learning algorithm, and returned again in. csv.
